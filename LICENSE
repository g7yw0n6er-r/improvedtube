COMMENT/Postamble: Reason for the specific restriction: 1. Some publishers use [our] code without permission commercially, with [excessive] adware/spyware. 
Together they can have more users than the original, since software is often not chosen well. 
Thus we rationally/responsibly have to care. - Inspite of the tendency for smart behavior, to be superior on a long-term, as assumed by licences like GNU, 
marketing / competition / economy are not fair in the present.  Billions of users dont review every software choice
(2. For this project we can't imagine requiring to ask first will hinder any good cause but only help each.)
